 * It's bonus time in the big city! The fatcats are rubbing their paws in anticipation... but who is going to make the most money?
 * Build a function that takes in two arguments (salary, bonus). Salary will be an integer, and bonus a boolean.
 * If bonus is true, the salary should be multiplied by 10. If bonus is false, the fatcat did not make enough money and must receive only his stated salary.
 * Return the total figure the individual will receive as a string prefixed with "Â£" (= "\u00A3", JS and Java) or "$" (C#, C++, Ruby, Clojure, Elixir, PHP and Python, Haskell).
